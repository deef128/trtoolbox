# trtoolbox
Toolbox for time-resolved spectroscopic data written in Python.

This toolbox was inspired by OPTIMUS written by Dr. Chavdar Slavov (https://optimusfit.org/). The global fit routine is based on ideas by Victor A. Lorenz Fonfria (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8859-8347). The LDA routine is based on the nicely written PyLDM package by Gabriel F. Dorlhiac (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005528).
