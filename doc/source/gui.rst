Using the GUI
=============

To start the GUI simply run *gui.py* in the trtoolbox folder. The two script files (*trtoolbox.sh* for bash/Linux and *trtoolbox.bat* for Windows) are a convenient way to activate an Anaconda environment and start the GUI. Do no forget to set the environment name and the Anaconda path in case of Windows.
